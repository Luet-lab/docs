Luet is a Package Manager based on containers. It provides an abstraction layer over container specfile format, enhancing the image resolution process of [OCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Container_Initiative) runtimes with [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) solving techniques.

Luet can be used to build [packages](/docs/docs/concepts/packages/), build container images and to manage and distribute installations of derived [packages](/docs/docs/concepts/packages/) locally.

Allows to apply semver [constraints](/docs/docs/concepts/constraints/) to Image dependencies, treating it as a classical [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem).
